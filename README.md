# Sudoku_BackTrack_Solver
Solver for Sudoku game developed in Python.


Algorithm

Starting with an incomplete board:

- Find some empty space
- Attempt to place the digits 1-9 in that space
- Check if that digit is valid in the current spot based on the current board
  - a. If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the board using steps 1-3.
  - b. If it is not valid, reset the square you just filled and go back to the previous step.
- Once the board is full by the definition of this algorithm we have found a solution.
